# Retail Customer Behavior & Shopping Trends – Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end **data analysis workflow** built using **Python, SQL (MySQL), and Power BI** to analyze retail customer behavior and shopping trends. It simulates a real-world, company-level analytics process followed by data analysts — from raw data preparation to business insights and visualization.

The goal of the project is to transform messy customer data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision making.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior and spending patterns  
- Understand the impact of discounts, subscriptions, and shipping types  
- Identify high-performing products and customer segments  
- Present insights through clear and interactive visualizations  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, SQLAlchemy) – data loading, cleaning, transformation, EDA  
- **MySQL** – database design and advanced SQL analysis  
- **SQL** – aggregations, CTEs, subqueries, window functions  
- **Power BI** – data visualization and dashboard creation

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Loaded raw retail customer data using Python
   - Cleaned missing values, standardized columns, and prepared data for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions, trends, and customer attributes using pandas
   - Identified key patterns and potential business questions

3. **SQL-Based Business Analysis**
   - Designed relational schema in MySQL
   - Wrote business-driven SQL queries to analyze:
     - Revenue by customer segment
     - Discount effectiveness
     - Subscription behavior
     - Product performance
     - Customer loyalty and repeat purchases

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Prepared analyzed data for BI tools
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards to communicate insights clearly

## Key Insights
- Spending behavior varies significantly across customer segments and subscription status  
- Certain products and categories consistently generate higher revenue  
- Discounts influence purchase behavior but do not always increase total spend  
- Loyal and repeat customers contribute disproportionately to revenue
